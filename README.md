# Data-Cleaning-with-Postgre-SQL

**Overview**
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a dataset related to layoffs. The aim is to prepare the data for analysis by addressing issues such as missing values, data type inconsistencies, and outliers. The refined dataset is suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

**Dataset Description**
The original dataset includes information about layoffs, featuring variables such as:
company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, date, stage, country, funds_raised_millions

**Tools and Technologies**
PostgreSQL: For database management and data cleaning.

**Steps Taken**
Data Import: Loaded the dataset into PostgreSQL.
Data Inspection: Evaluated the dataset for missing values and inconsistencies.

**Data Cleaning:**
Eliminated duplicates.
Addressed missing values by either imputing or removing records.

**Prerequisites:**
PostgreSQL installed on your machine.
Access to the original dataset (included in the repository).

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates my skills in cleaning and preprocessing datasets using PostgreSQL. The processed dataset is now ready for analysis and can be utilized to gain insights into layoffs across various companies.
